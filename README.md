# Virtual-Event-Management

This Project has been created as an assignment for Internet Programming Laboratory . It uses basic CSS and JavaScript to design and modulate a user-interactive and responsive website that allows customers to create and host virtual events.
Users can login/register and create or join event.It is just a simple frontend part and is only for explanation purposes as it is yet to be connected to an API or database.
